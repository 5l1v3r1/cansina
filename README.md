Cansina
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/deibit/cansina.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deibit/cansina)

Cansina is a Web Content Discovery Application.

It is well known Web applications don't publish all their resources or public links,
so the only way to discover these resources is requesting for them and check the response.

Cansina duty is to help you making requests and filtering and inspecting the responses to tell
apart if it is an existing resource or just an annoying or disguised 404.

Feature requests and comments are welcome.

Cansina is included in [BlackArch Linux](https://www.blackarch.org/), give it a try!

Installing dependencies
=======================

pip install --user requests[security] or pip install -r requeriments.txt

(try removing --user and install with sudo in case of errors)

git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/deibit/cansina


Fast use
========

$ python3 cansina.py -u <site_url> -p <payload_file> --persist

Cansina is Python 2 compatible but 3 is more than advisable.
